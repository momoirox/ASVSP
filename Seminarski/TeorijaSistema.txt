This is a Docker Compose file that defines a multi-container application for Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper, which is a popular distributed streaming platform.
 It includes the following containers:

ZooKeeper (zoo1): This container is used to manage the Kafka cluster's configuration and state.

Kafka brokers (kafka1 and kafka2): These are the main components of the Kafka cluster that handle the storage and processing of data.

Kafka producer (producer): This container generates data and sends it to the Kafka cluster.

Init-kafka: This container is used to initialize the Kafka topics and set up the necessary configuration.

The Docker Compose file also includes environment variables and volume mounts to configure the containers and ensure data persistence.

By running this Docker Compose file, you can easily create a local Kafka cluster and start producing and consuming data.
